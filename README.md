# pokestats
Streamlined pokemon stat searching with a simple UI

A CLI tool I wrote to help me search pokemon stats quickly! 

Expanding into a flask web app. Thought it might be nice with a little GUI, but not too much :)

## Running the Flask app
The Flask app can be run in dev mode as `flask --app pokestats run` from the main directory. 

## Running the CLI tool
Admittedly, the CLI tool is a little more advanced than the web app at the moment. The tool
is housed in `pokemon.py` and can be run the usual way as `python3 pokemon.py`. 


## What's ahead
Once I finalize the CLI tool, it's web time. A simple search bar that will return easy-to-read 
information about different types, pokemon, and moves. 

I'd like for it to be able to suggest efficient combos for tera raids (ie. what will be strong against
a magneton with a bug tera type).
